# coder_workspace (Data Source)

Use this data source to get information for the active workspace build.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "coder" {}

provider "docker" {}

data "coder_workspace" "me" {}

data "coder_workspace_owner" "me" {}

resource "coder_agent" "dev" {
  arch = "amd64"
  os   = "linux"
  dir  = "/workspace"
}

resource "docker_container" "workspace" {
  count = data.coder_workspace.me.start_count
  image = docker_image.main.name
  # Uses lower() to avoid Docker restriction on container names.
  name = "coder-${data.coder_workspace_owner.me.name}-${lower(data.coder_workspace.me.name)}"
  # Hostname makes the shell more user friendly: coder@my-workspace:~$
  hostname = data.coder_workspace.me.name
  # Use the docker gateway if the access URL is 127.0.0.1
  entrypoint = ["sh", "-c", replace(coder_agent.main.init_script, "/localhost|127\\.0\\.0\\.1/", "host.docker.internal")]
  env        = ["CODER_AGENT_TOKEN=${coder_agent.main.token}"]
  host {
    host = "host.docker.internal"
    ip   = "host-gateway"
  }
  # Add labels in Docker to keep track of orphan resources.
  labels {
    label = "coder.owner"
    value = data.coder_workspace_owner.me.name
  }
  labels {
    label = "coder.owner_id"
    value = data.coder_workspace_owner.me.id
  }
  labels {
    label = "coder.workspace_id"
    value = data.coder_workspace.me.id
  }
  labels {
    label = "coder.workspace_name"
    value = data.coder_workspace.me.name
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Read-Only

- `access_port` (Number) The access port of the Coder deployment provisioning this workspace.
- `access_url` (String) The access URL of the Coder deployment provisioning this workspace. This is the base URL without a trailing slash (e.g., "https://coder.example.com" or "https://coder.example.com:8080").
- `id` (String) UUID of the workspace.
- `is_prebuild` (Boolean) Similar to `prebuild_count`, but a boolean value instead of a count. This is set to true if the workspace is a currently unassigned prebuild. Once the workspace is assigned, this value will be false.
- `is_prebuild_claim` (Boolean) Indicates whether a prebuilt workspace has just been claimed and this is the first `apply` after that occurrence.
- `name` (String) Name of the workspace.
- `prebuild_count` (Number) A computed count, equal to 1 if the workspace is a currently unassigned prebuild. Use this to conditionally act on the status of a prebuild. Actions that do not require user identity can be taken when this value is set to 1. Actions that should only be taken once the workspace has been assigned to a user may be taken when this value is set to 0.
- `start_count` (Number) A computed count based on `transition` state. If `start`, count will equal 1.
- `template_id` (String) ID of the workspace's template.
- `template_name` (String) Name of the workspace's template.
- `template_version` (String) Version of the workspace's template.
- `transition` (String) Either `start` or `stop`. Use this to start/stop resources with `count`.
