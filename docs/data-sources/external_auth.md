# coder_external_auth (Data Source)

Use this data source to require users to authenticate with an external service prior to workspace creation. This can be used to [pre-authenticate external services](https://coder.com/docs/admin/external-auth) in a workspace. (e.g. Google Cloud, Github, Docker, etc.)

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "coder" {}


data "coder_external_auth" "github" {
 id = "github"
}

data "coder_external_auth" "azure-identity" {
 id = "azure-identiy"
 optional = true
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) The ID of a configured external auth provider set up in your Coder deployment.

### Optional

- `optional` (Boolean) Authenticating with the external auth provider is not required, and can be skipped by users when creating or updating workspaces
