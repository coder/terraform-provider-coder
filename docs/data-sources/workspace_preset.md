# coder_workspace_preset (Data Source)

Use this data source to predefine common configurations for coder workspaces. Users will have the option to select a defined preset, which will automatically apply the selected configuration. Any parameters defined in the preset will be applied to the workspace. Parameters that are defined by the template but not defined by the preset will still be configurable when creating a workspace.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "coder" {}

# presets can be used to predefine common configurations for workspaces
# Parameters are referenced by their name. Each parameter must be defined in the preset.
# Values defined by the preset must pass validation for the parameter.
# See the coder_parameter data source's documentation for examples of how to define
# parameters like the ones used below.
data "coder_workspace_preset" "example" {
  name = "example"
  parameters = {
    (data.coder_parameter.example.name) = "us-central1-a"
    (data.coder_parameter.ami.name)     = "ami-xxxxxxxx"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the workspace preset.

### Optional

- `parameters` (Map of String) Workspace parameters that will be set by the workspace preset. For simple templates that only need prebuilds, you may define a preset with zero parameters. Because workspace parameters may change between Coder template versions, preset parameters are allowed to define values for parameters that do not exist in the current template version.
- `prebuilds` (Block Set, Max: 1) Configuration for prebuilt workspaces associated with this preset. Coder will maintain a pool of standby workspaces based on this configuration. When a user creates a workspace using this preset, they are assigned a prebuilt instance instead of waiting for a new one to build. See prebuilt workspace documentation [here](https://coder.com/docs/admin/templates/extending-templates/prebuilt-workspaces.md) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--prebuilds))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The preset ID is automatically generated and may change between runs. It is recommended to use the `name` attribute to identify the preset.

<a id="nestedblock--prebuilds"></a>
### Nested Schema for `prebuilds`

Required:

- `instances` (Number) The number of workspaces to keep in reserve for this preset.
