## Example Usage

```terraform
data "coder_workspace" "me" {}

resource "coder_agent" "dev" {
  os             = "linux"
  arch           = "amd64"
  dir            = "/workspace"
  startup_script = <<EOF
curl -fsSL https://code-server.dev/install.sh | sh
code-server --auth none --port 13337
EOF
}

resource "coder_app" "code-server" {
  agent_id              = coder_agent.dev.id
  name                  = "VS Code"
  icon                  = data.coder_workspace.me.access_url + "/icons/vscode.svg"
  url                   = "http://localhost:13337"
  relative_path         = true
  healthcheck_url       = "http://localhost:13337/healthz"
  healthcheck_interval  = 5
  healthcheck_threshold = 6
}

resource "coder_app" "vim" {
  agent_id = coder_agent.dev.id
  name     = "Vim"
  icon     = data.coder_workspace.me.access_url + "/icons/vim.svg"
  command  = "vim"
}

resource "coder_app" "intellij" {

## Schema

### Required

- `agent_id` (String) The "id" property of a "coder_agent" resource to associate with.

### Optional

- `command` (String) A command to run in a terminal opening this app. In the web, this will open in a new tab. In the CLI, this will SSH and execute the command. Either "command" or "url" may be specified, but not both.
- `healthcheck_interval` (Number) Duration in seconds to wait between healthcheck requests.
- `healthcheck_threshold` (Number) Number of consecutive heathcheck failures before returning an unhealthy status.
- `healthcheck_url` (String) HTTP address used determine the application readiness. A successful health check is a HTTP response code less than 500 returned before healthcheck_interval seconds.
- `icon` (String) A URL to an icon that will display in the dashboard. View built-in icons here: https://github.com/coder/coder/tree/main/site/static/icons. Use a built-in icon with `data.coder_workspace.me.access_url + "/icons/<path>"`.
- `name` (String) A display name to identify the app.
- `relative_path` (Boolean) Specifies whether the URL will be accessed via a relative path or wildcard. Use if wildcard routing is unavailable.
