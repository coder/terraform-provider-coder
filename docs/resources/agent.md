# coder_agent (Resource)

Use this resource to associate an agent.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "coder_workspace" "me" {
}

resource "coder_agent" "dev" {
  os   = "linux"
  arch = "amd64"
  dir  = "/workspace"
  display_apps {
    vscode          = true
    vscode_insiders = false
    web_terminal    = true
    ssh_helper      = false
  }
}

resource "kubernetes_pod" "dev" {
  count = data.coder_workspace.me.start_count
  spec {
    container {
      command = ["sh", "-c", coder_agent.dev.init_script]
      env {
        name  = "CODER_AGENT_TOKEN"
        value = coder_agent.dev.token
      }
    }

## Schema

### Required

- `arch` (String) The architecture the agent will run on. Must be one of: "amd64", "armv7", "arm64".
- `os` (String) The operating system the agent will run on. Must be one of: "linux", "darwin", or "windows".

### Optional

- `auth` (String) The authentication type the agent will use. Must be one of: "token", "google-instance-identity", "aws-instance-identity", "azure-instance-identity".
- `connection_timeout` (Number) Time in seconds until the agent is marked as timed out when a connection with the server cannot be established. A value of zero never marks the agent as timed out.
- `dir` (String) The starting directory when a user creates a shell session. Defaults to $HOME.
- `display_apps` (Block Set, Max: 1) The list of built-in apps to display in the agent bar. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--display_apps))
- `env` (Map of String) A mapping of environment variables to set inside the workspace.
- `login_before_ready` (Boolean, Deprecated) This option defines whether or not the user can (by default) login to the workspace before it is ready. Ready means that e.g. the startup_script is done and has exited. When enabled, users may see an incomplete workspace when logging in.
- `metadata` (Block List) Each "metadata" block defines a single item consisting of a key/value pair. This feature is in alpha and may break in future releases. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--metadata))
- `motd_file` (String) The path to a file within the workspace containing a message to display to users when they login via SSH. A typical value would be /etc/motd.
- `shutdown_script` (String) A script to run before the agent is stopped. The script should exit when it is done to signal that the workspace can be stopped.
- `shutdown_script_timeout` (Number) Time in seconds until the agent lifecycle status is marked as timed out during shutdown, this happens when the shutdown script has not completed (exited) in the given time.
- `startup_script` (String) A script to run after the agent starts. The script should exit when it is done to signal that the agent is ready.
- `startup_script_behavior` (String) This option sets the behavior of the `startup_script`. When set to "blocking", the startup_script must exit before the workspace is ready. When set to "non-blocking", the startup_script may run in the background and the workspace will be ready immediately. Default is "non-blocking", although "blocking" is recommended.
- `startup_script_timeout` (Number) Time in seconds until the agent lifecycle status is marked as timed out during start, this happens when the startup script has not completed (exited) in the given time.
- `troubleshooting_url` (String) A URL to a document with instructions for troubleshooting problems with the agent.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `init_script` (String) Run this script on startup of an instance to initialize the agent.
- `token` (String, Sensitive) Set the environment variable "CODER_AGENT_TOKEN" with this token to authenticate an agent.

- `script` (String) The script that retrieves the value of this metadata item.

Optional:

- `display_name` (String) The user-facing name of this value.
- `timeout` (Number) The maximum time the command is allowed to run in seconds.
