# terraform-provider-coder

Terraform provider for [Coder](https://github.com/coder/coder).

### Developing

#### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)

We recommend using [`nix`](https://nixos.org/download.html) to manage your development environment. If you have `nix` installed, you can run `nix develop` to enter a shell with all the necessary dependencies.

Alternatively, you can install the dependencies manually.

#### Building

Follow the instructions outlined in the [Terraform documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/config/config-file#development-overrides-for-provider-developers)
to setup your local Terraform to use your local version rather than the registry version.

1. Create a file named `.terraformrc` in your `$HOME` directory
2. Add the following content:

   ```hcl
    provider_installation {
        # Override the coder/coder provider to use your local version
        dev_overrides {
          "coder/coder" = "/path/to/terraform-provider-coder"
        }

        # For all other providers, install them directly from their origin provider
        # registries as normal. If you omit this, Terraform will _only_ use
        # the dev_overrides block, and so no other providers will be available.
        direct {}
    }
   ```

3. (optional, but recommended) Validate your configuration:
   1. Create a new `main.tf` file and include:
   ```hcl
   terraform {
       required_providers {
           coder = {
               source = "coder/coder"
           }
       }
   }
   ```
   2. Run `terraform init` and observe a warning like `Warning: Provider development overrides are in effect`
4. Run `go build -o terraform-provider-coder` to build the provider binary, which Terraform will try locate and execute
5. All local Terraform runs will now use your local provider!
6. _**NOTE**: we vendor in this provider into `github.com/coder/coder`, so if you're testing with a local clone then you should also run `go mod edit -replace github.com/coder/terraform-provider-coder=/path/to/terraform-provider-coder` in your clone._

#### Terraform Acceptance Tests

To run Terraform acceptance tests, run `make testacc`. This will test the provider against the locally installed version of Terraform.

> **Note:** our [CI workflow](./github/workflows/test.yml) runs a test matrix against multiple Terraform versions.

#### Integration Tests

The tests under the `./integration` directory perform the following steps:

- Build the local version of the provider,
- Run an in-memory Coder instance with a specified version,
- Validate the behaviour of the local provider against that specific version of Coder.

To run these integration tests locally:

1. Pull the version of the Coder image you wish to test:

   ```console
     docker pull ghcr.io/coder/coder-preview:main-x.y.z-devel-abcd1234
   ```

1. Run `CODER_IMAGE=ghcr.io/coder/coder-preview CODER_VERSION=main-x.y.z-devel-abcd1234 make test-integration`.

> **Note:** you can specify `CODER_IMAGE` if the Coder image you wish to test is hosted somewhere other than `ghcr.io/coder/coder`.
> For example, `CODER_IMAGE=example.com/repo/coder CODER_VERSION=foobar make test-integration`.
